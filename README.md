## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) - For generating maps
- [IP Geolocation Api](https://geo.ipify.org/) - For getting ip information
- [Tailwind Css](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styling

### Useful resources

- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63740794/deploy-failed-netlify) - This helped me when deploying the app on netlify due to "build fail" and react-leaflet missing dependency.
- [React-leaflet-docs](https://react-leaflet.js.org/docs/start-setup/) - The react-leaflet official documentation.
